Bison Mode for Sublime
======================

I couldn't find a suitable mode for bison files so I wrote one myself.  It tries to
handle then special syntax of the bison files and the highlighting works for the
files I currently handle.

The code is not yet 100% functional, though.  Block folding isn't reliable, definitions
are not marked yet (although I tried with the appropriate file).
